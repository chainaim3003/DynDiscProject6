// PROJ1-DYN3-CONT8 / M2-ε — Intent-driven negotiation types
// =============================================================================
//
// Shared between:
//   - cli-parser.ts            (resolves --scenario <id> to an Intent + situation)
//   - buyer-agent/index.ts     (consumes BuyerIntent; today: extracts CLI args
//                                 only, full honoring deferred to CONT9+)
//   - seller-agent/index.ts    (consumes SellerIntent; today: receives but
//                                 does not act on it differently, full
//                                 honoring deferred — needs envelope wire)
//   - UI components            (renders intents in ScenarioCard for the demo
//                                 picker; mirrored in ui/src/lib/intent-types.ts)
//
// Design notes
// ------------
//
// 1. An *Intent* declares what an agent is TRYING to do, not what it WILL do.
//    Hard constraints define walk-away conditions. Soft preferences shape
//    direction. Style (TKI-ish) shapes how aggressively the agent moves from
//    anchor toward soft target. Walk-away behavior defines what happens when
//    hard constraints can't be met.
//
// 2. The agent's existing decision logic (LLM + advisor consultation + math
//    aggregator + guardrails) becomes the MACHINERY that EXECUTES the intent.
//    The intent is the goal; guardrails enforce the hard constraints; LLM
//    reasoning navigates the soft preferences. This means we are NOT
//    replacing the agent's brain — we are giving it a goal to pursue.
//
// 3. This is the OPPOSITE of the CONT5 --buyer-anchor / --rounds /
//    --seller-margin-price flags approach, which would have made agents
//    puppets to script demo outcomes. Intent-driven keeps agents autonomous
//    and makes the SCENARIO describe what was attempted, not what literally
//    happens. Outcomes remain probabilistic in a bounded, explainable way.
//
// 4. The Scenario shape pairs BuyerIntent + SellerIntent + situation. It is
//    the unit a scenario card declares and the unit cli-parser loads when
//    `--scenario <id>` is passed.
//
// 5. Today (CONT8), only `situation.product`, `situation.quantity`, and
//    `buyerIntent.hardConstraints.maxBudgetPerUnit` flow through to agent
//    behavior — these are what the existing multi-dim CLI form already
//    accepts. Everything else (goals, styles, soft preferences, walk-away,
//    sellerIntent in any form) is declared in the scenario JSON, displayed
//    to the user in the card, and logged by the buyer agent's parsedResult
//    handler, but does not yet drive agent decisions. Wiring this through
//    is the explicit deliverable of a future CONT iteration (see
//    FRAMEWORK-V2 §12 D7 if/when added).

//
// Subset of `Scenario` carried across the wire from buyer → seller (via
// `OfferData.scenarioIntent?`) so the seller's audit block can record the
// declared intent it was responding to.
//
// IMPORTANT — audit-only:
//   The seller's runtime behavior is STILL driven by its .env
//   (SELLER_RESPONSE_MODE) and hardcoded SELLER_CONFIG. Receiving this
//   excerpt does NOT cause the seller to honor `sellerIntent.goal`,
//   `sellerIntent.style`, etc. — those remain deferred. Iter 3 only
//   reads the excerpt at deal close to populate the `intent` audit block
//   on the seller's audit JSON.
//
// See AUDIT-FRAMEWORK-V6-DECISIONS.md § "2026-05-24 — Notes addendum: Iter 3
// vocabulary lock" Item 6 for the design lock.
//
// Why an excerpt and not the full Scenario? Three reasons:
//   1. Forward compatibility — `Scenario.honored` and `Scenario.description`
//      are author metadata for the UI card; the seller's audit doesn't
//      need them and including them would couple the wire schema to UI
//      concerns.
//   2. Size discipline — the OFFER envelope is signed and hashed; keeping
//      its payload focused is good hygiene.
//   3. Audit honesty — only the fields that materially describe the
//      mandate belong on the audit block.
